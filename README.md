so this is a simple manually refreshed express app
just clone and npm i
after you are all setup, then change the port and the mongodb connection string to your own string.
And do nodemon or node index.js 
when the app runs first you need to register some users.
open up the app in several tabs so it is gonna much easier and i have not implemented the blocking functionality yet.
